# Personal-Expenses

## Introduction

Ever get that paycheck, think life is good, and then wonder where it all disappeared to a few days later? Yeah, relatable. So, I'm diving into the basicsâ€”tracking expenses on things we all have in common, like entertainment, groceries, and a few other essentials. One of my main challenges? Understanding my spending habits, especially on ordering food through various apps and keeping an eye on those sneaky monthly recurring payments.

Now, here's the twist. To maintain some spending secrets, I'm creating a separate column that describes the category of the spending. No need for full disclosure, just a savvy way to keep a bit of financial privacy. Ready to join me on this simple journey to financial clarity?

And the data we'll be exploring? I'm rolling up my sleeves and digging into the details of my PayPal and bank statements. Join me on this simple journey to financial clarity, where we dissect the numbers and uncover the stories they tell.
